 ## Detecting a nil value
 
 So, how do we deal with a *nil*, the absence of a value?
 
 What do you think the following code will do?  Type it and find out:
 
 ![check-nil](check-nil.png)
 
 Is the result what you expected?
 
 */
// Type your code below this line
var dayOfWeak : String? = "Monday"
if dayOfWeak != nil{
    print("The day is \(dayOfWeak)")
} else {
    print("no day was provided")
}


/*:
 
 Now change the first line to:
 
 ![set-monday](set-monday.png)
 
 Run the code again.
 
 Is the result *exactly* what you expected?  Look closely at the output.
